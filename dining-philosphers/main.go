// The Dining Philosophers problem is well known in computer science circles.
// Five, philosophers, numbered from 0 through 4, live in a house where the
// table is laid for them; each philosopher has their own place at the table.
// Their only difficulty - besides those of philosophy - is that the dish
// served is a very difficult kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with
// two forks. There are two forks next to each place, so that presents no
// difficulty. As a consequence, however, this means that no two neighbors
// may be eating simultaneously, since there are five philosophers and five forks.
//
// This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's solution to the "Dining
// Philosophers" dilemma.
